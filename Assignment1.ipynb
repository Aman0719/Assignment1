    "Q2. Which type of programming does python support?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- The python is the interpreted programming language and it supports basically four types of programming, namely\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.\tImperative programming- Imperative programming is type of programming, where functions are implicitly coded in every step required to solve a problem.\n",
    "                                In this, every operation is coded and the code itself specifies how the problem is to be solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.\tFunctional programming-  Though Python is not primarily a functional language, but it is able to support functional programming relatively easily because everything in Python is an object. \n",
    "                                 That means that function definitions can be assigned to variables and passed around. Here we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style. \n",
    "                                 Its main focus is on “what to solve” in contrast to an imperative style where the main focus is “how to solve“.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.\tProcedural programming-  as the name suggests, in this type of programming, the code is executed in procedural or step by step way to develop any application. \n",
    "                                 In simple terms, it follows a particular direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.\tObject-oriented programming- An object-oriented paradigm is to design the program using classes and objects. \n",
    "                                     It allows you to define classes to create objects. In-built Python classes are the most common data types in Python, such as strings, lists, dictionaries, and so on\n",

    "                                In Python, conditional statements are defined using if, elif, and else keywords.\n",

    "               Python provides two types of loops: for loops and while loops.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans- Memory management can be defined as allocating a block of space in the computer memory to an object in Python. \n",
    "     In Python, the Python Memory manager automatically manages the memory through a dedicated process known as reference counting. Each object in Python has a reference count, which keeps track of the number of references to that object. \n",
